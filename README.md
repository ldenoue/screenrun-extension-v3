# ScreenRun

ScreenRun is a browser extension to quickly record your tab and voice.

Tested on Chrome. Thanks for letting me know if it works in other browsers.

# Install on Chrome

Or load the unpacked extension from GitHub:
- `git clone https://github.com/ldenoue/screenrun-extension.git` and then open Chrome `Manage Extensions` and click `Load Unpacked` to pick the folder where you cloned this repo.
